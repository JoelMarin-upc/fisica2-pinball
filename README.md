# Pinball

## Description

This project replicates a famous game named Pinball, that consist on flipping leavers in order for the ball to not fall from the board.
The project uses the Box2D v2.4.1 library to simulate realistic physics, and it also uses the raylib v5.5.0 library to render graphics on the screen.

## Key Features

 - You have 3 balls at start
 - Balls launched from starting position
 - Activate flippers to keep the ball in the board
 - Points are added for hitting objects
 - If the ball falls off the board you can throw the next ball 
 - If there are no more balls you lose and the game restarts 
 
## Controls
